##### New: Reset User Password via Chatbot
- This playbooks should be triggered by a Slack or a Teams message from a user requesting to reset their forgotten password.
The playbook seeks approval before resetting the user's password. It then generates a new password for the user, meeting the complexity criteria defined in the playbook inputs, and sends an email to the user with the new password.
The only information required from the user requesting the password reset in this playbook is the "reporteremailaddress" field, which should hold the email address of the user asking for password reset.
