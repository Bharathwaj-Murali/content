#### Playbooks
##### New: Threat Hunting - Set Indicators
- Created a new playbook that normalizes a variety of indicators to facilitate their use within threat hunting and detection playbooks, as well as reduce the possibility of task errors.
Using this playbook as a sub-playbook in threat hunting and detection playbooks is particularly useful if inputs are manually entered.
<!--The playbook removes duplications, splits each input into an array of strings, and then stores the indicators under newly created context keys.
Note that multiple search values should be separated by commas only (without spaces or any special characters e.g. 10.0.0.1,10.0.0.2).
Supported IOCs for this playbook:
- MD5
- SHA1
- SHA256
- IP Address
- URLDomain
- Registry Value
- Registry Key
- Registry Hives
- Command Line
- File Name
- Process Name
- HTTP Request Methods
- User Agent
- Port Number
- File Path
- Geolocation
- Email Address
- CIDR
- URI
-->

##### New: Threat Hunting - Sort Results
- Created a new playbook that sorts the results of threat hunting and detection playbooks. The output of the playbook facilitates pivoting searches for IP addresses, users, and hosts that may be affected.
<!--The playbook receives IPs, email addresses, and hosts provided manually or obtained by threat hunting and detection playbooks. The playbook then determines whether an object is internal or external by utilizing the internal domains, hosts regex, and internal IP ranges provided in the playbook inputs.
