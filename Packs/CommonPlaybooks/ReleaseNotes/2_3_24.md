#### Playbooks
##### New: Threat Hunting - Set Indicators
- Created a new playbook that processes a variety of indicators by parsing and storing them as arrays under newly created context keys.
The playbook outputs can then be used to improve the efficiency of various threat hunting playbooks.

The following IOCs are included in the playbook:
MD5, SHA1, SHA256, IP Address, URLDomain, Registry Value, Registry Key, Registry Hives, Command Line, File Name, Process Name, HTTP Request Methods, User Agent, Port Number, File Path, Geolocation, Email Address, CIDR, URI, Ja3, FileType (Available from Cortex XSOAR 6.5.0).

##### New: Threat Hunting - Sort Results
- Created a new playbook for sorting the results of hunting and threat detection. The output of the playbook facilitates pivoting searches for IP addresses, users, and hosts that may be affected.
